This is a test task, a prototype of a card game like ‘Slay The Spire’. The visual part of the project is quite simple, it is only needed for display, the main focus was on the code.

- It starts in the ‘GameEntryPoint’ class, it is initialised before the main game and initialises the main managers, as well as tracks the loading/unloading of scenes
- On the game stage itself is ‘BattleEntryPoint’, it is responsible for the correct initialisation of everything on the stage itself
- The main game logic is described through the ‘Battle’ class
- UI is implemented via MVC pattern
